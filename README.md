A text editor using Java. It *might* be similar to Atom.

### Contributing
To contribute to this repo, clone it and import the resulting Editor folder to eclipse. And choose the ```pom.xml``` file in eclipse, and voil&agrave;!

You also need to have ```EGit``` and ```m2e``` plugins installed, in case you want to push or add dependencies.

### Current Issues

I want to add multi-tab browsing at some point, but ```JPanel```'s glitching out. And I gave up. HELP. 

A Work In Progress (WIP)

*Tested on Windows 10 x64*
